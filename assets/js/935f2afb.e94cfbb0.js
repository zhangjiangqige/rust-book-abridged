We\'re going to introduce a bunch of concepts but not go into anything in too much detail in this chapter.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ch03-common-programming-concepts":{"id":"ch03-common-programming-concepts","title":"3 - Common Programming Concepts","description":"In which we learn about variables, basic types, functions, comments, and control flow.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ch04-ownership":{"id":"ch04-ownership","title":"4 - Ownership, References, and Slices","description":"Ownership is Rust\'s most unique feature and has deep implications for the rest of the language.

A trait defines some set of behavior, and every struct that implements the trait needs to implement that behavior.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ch10/ch10-03-lifetimes":{"id":"ch10/ch10-03-lifetimes","title":"10.3 - Validating References with Lifetimes","description":"This chapter explains lifetimes in a somewhat different, and slightly more technical way than the original \\"The Rust Programming Language\\" did. If you find the explanation here confusing, you might try reading the original, or check the end of this section for some additional reading. Lifetimes can be one of the more confusing parts of Rust if you\'re a newcomer. They\'re a result of Rust\'s unique ownership system, so there aren\'t any direct analogs in other languages. As a result, many attempts have been made to explain them, so if you have a hard time don\'t give up! Somewhere out there, someone will explain this in a way that clicks for you.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ch11-automated-tests":{"id":"ch11-automated-tests","title":"11 - Writing Automated Tests","description":"11.1 - How to Write Tests","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ch12-io-project-cli":{"id":"ch12-io-project-cli","title":"12 - An I/O Project: Building a Command Line Program","description":"We know enough Rust now that we can actually write a useful program.

We\'ll also learn about iterators which are used for iterating over a collection of items.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ch14-more-about-cargo":{"id":"ch14-more-about-cargo","title":"14 - More about Cargo and Crates","description":"14.1 - Customizing Builds with Release Profiles","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ch15-smart-pointers":{"id":"ch15-smart-pointers","title":"15 - Smart Pointers","description":"In C++, whenever we want to store an object on the heap, we new that object to allocate some memory. At some later point in time, we have to delete that memory. This is much like malloc and free in standard C.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ch16-fearless-concurrency":{"id":"ch16-fearless-concurrency","title":"16 - Fearless Concurrency","description":"Concurrent programming has a lot of potential pit falls - race conditions, thread safe access to variables - in other languages these problems show up in production as tricky to reproduce problems. Access to memory is handled through Rust\'s type system and ownership rules, and it turns out these rules can do an excellent job of catching many concurrency problems at compile time too.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ch17-object-oriented-features":{"id":"ch17-object-oriented-features","title":"17 - Object Oriented Features of Rust","description":"17.1 - Characteristics of Object Oriented Languages","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ch18-patterns-and-matching":{"id":"ch18-patterns-and-matching","title":"18 - Patterns and Matching","description":"18.1 - All the Places Patterns Can Be Used","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ch19/ch19-01-unsafe":{"id":"ch19/ch19-01-unsafe","title":"19.1 - Unsafe Rust","description":"This chapter is meant as an introduction to unsafe code, but if you find yourself actually writing unsafe code, it would be a good idea to read through the Rustonomicon. There are many things you can do in unsafe code that will result in undefined behavior, some of which you might surprise you if you\'re coming from a language like C/C++.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ch19/ch19-02-advanced-traits":{"id":"ch19/ch19-02-advanced-traits","title":"19.2 - Advanced Traits","description":"For an introduction to traits, see chapter 10.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ch19/ch19-03-advanced-types":{"id":"ch19/ch19-03-advanced-types","title":"19.3 - Advanced Types","description":"Using the Newtype Pattern for Type Safety and Abstraction","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ch19/ch19-04-advanced-functions-and-closures":{"id":"ch19/ch19-04-advanced-functions-and-closures","title":"19.4 - Advanced Functions and Closures","description":"Function Pointers","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ch19/ch19-05-macros":{"id":"ch19/ch19-05-macros","title":"19.5 - Macros","description":"If you\'re coming to Rust from C or C++, then you\'re no doubt already familiar with macros.

Let\'s see if we can get our server to shut down gracefully.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ch21-async":{"id":"ch21-async","title":"21 - Async Programming","description":"In this section we\'re going to re-implement our web server from chapter 20 using async functions.
